# Gitlab Android

This is just a personal project that was born as an application to learn and practice concepts about Android development.

The entire app is developed in Kotlin as an alternative to Java. I use Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture with MVP pattern (Model View Presenter) and I apply concepts of functional programming and reactive programming. The application also has some bites of Material Design using Google Design Library.

So I hope that this project can be useful in some way to someone.

## Libraries

These are the main libraries that the app uses:

* Kotlin
* Kotlin Android Extensions
* Retrofit
* RxJava/RxAndroid
* Google Design Library
